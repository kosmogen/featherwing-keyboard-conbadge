# Featherwing Keyboard Con Badge

Use a [Featherwing Keyboard](https://www.solder.party/docs/keyboard-featherwing/) as a con badge! Supports any Arduino compatible feather. 

(In theory this should work with other Adafruit TFT displays but that hasn't been tested yet)

## Features

Reads "badge1.bmp" from an SD card and displays it on the TFT as the badge. If the image or SD card isn't present, it displays the specified text instead.

## Future work

Iterate bitmaps on the SD card and display them as a slideshow.
